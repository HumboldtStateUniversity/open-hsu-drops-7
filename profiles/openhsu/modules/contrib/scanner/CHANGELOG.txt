#1587488 by ericras: Better notice when no matches found when replacing.
By ericras: Remove permission descriptions, not needed.
By ericras: Change search regexp to match all results & display in ul.

By ericras: Proper html display of "Can't display search result..." warning.
By ericras: Fix errant use of $search_db in D6->D7 upgrade from db_query to
  db_select.
  Whole word search was broken. $search_db no longer needed as we are not
  building a string of query params any longer with D7. Need to use $where
  string in the conditions because that includes the [[:<:]] brackets.
By ericras: Properly combine (now removed) $search_db and $where into new
  $where.
By ericras: Change 'scanning' to 'searching' for consistency.
By ericras: Update variable names and structure to be more standard.
